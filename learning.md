# Next JS

`
- Project can be created using npx create-next-app@latest
- create app folder in src level and add layout.tsx, this file will be the root file where <html> and <body> tags should be present, we wrap the children inside those tags.
- public folder to store the assets and stuff
- next.js supports built-in typescript support
- set up next lint in scripts of package.json (npm run lint will help to run)
